# Vulnerability Scanner

### Prerequisites:
* [Python](https://www.python.org) - Required install
* [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.45/getting-started/installation/) - Required install
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - Optional install
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - Optional install - MacOS
* Understanding of Python - Required

### How to run locally:
This project uses the following packages to run it locally:

* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)
* [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

Run the following command to install dependencies required to run the API locally in your terminal/command prompt: 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once the dependencies are installed, to start the API locally you need to run:

```uvicorn main:app --reload```

This will start the API running locally on: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. uvicorn will direct you to another endpoint in your terminal/command prompt if something is currently using port 8000.

Congrats! The api is now running locally.

A good way to test it is working is to do a GET request using Postman on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/container?name=node:18`. You will get a message indicating that you have not scanned a container named node:18 yet.

Depending on your machine, to stop the API running locally use the command for your machine to stop a running process in your terminal/command prompt where you ran ```uvicorn main:app --reload```.

### Endpoints

To see the full API's functionality, and possible parameters and endpoints, just navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in a web browser while the app is running. This will dynamically update as new endpoints and functionality is added.
